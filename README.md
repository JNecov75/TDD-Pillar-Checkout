# TDD-Pillar-Checkout
This is the Checkout Order Total Kata, done for my Pillar interview. The description of this Kata is at the bottom.

# Prerequisites
This library was build with dotnet core 2.2, and the test project was built with ms-test in visual studio code.
Dotnet core 2.2 can be found at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer.

# How to build
Once you have pulled this project and installed dotnet core 2.2, open a console window in your tool of choice, navigate to the top level project folder at `<your/path/to>/PointOfSale` and run `dotnet build` in your console.

# How to run the tests
Navigate to the test project folder: `<your/path/to>/PointOfSale/PointOfSale.Tests`. Once there, simply typ either `dotnet watch run` or `dotnet watch test` to see the project's tests run.
